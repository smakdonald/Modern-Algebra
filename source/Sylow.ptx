            For a prime number <m>p</m>, a <m>p</m>-group is a group of order <m>p^m</m> for some <m>m\in \mathbb{Z},m &gt; 0</m>.

            If <m>p</m> is a prime number and <m>G</m> is a finite group of order <m>p^m</m> for some <m>m &gt; 0</m>, then <m>Z(G)</m> is not the trivial group (In fact <m>|Z(G)|=p^a</m> for some <m>a&gt;0</m>).

        <proof>
          <p>
            Let <m>g_1,\ldots g_r \in G</m> be a list of unique representatives of all of the conjugacy classes of <m>G</m> of size greater than 1 as in the class equation. Then for each <m>i</m>, <m>C_G(g_i)\neq G</m> so <m>[G:C_G(g_i)]\neq 1</m>. Since <m>1\neq [G:C_G(g_i)] \mid |G|=p^m</m>, it follows that <m>p\mid [G:C_G(g_i)]</m> for each <m>i</m>. From the Class equation we deduce that <m>p\mid |Z(G)|</m> so, <m>|Z(G)|\neq 1</m>.

        <statement>
          <p>
            Let <m>G</m> be a finite group and <m>p</m> a prime. Write the order of <m>G</m> as <m>|G| = p^e m</m> where <m>p \nmid m</m>. A <em>Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroup</em> of <m>G</m> is a subgroup <m>H \leq G</m> such that <m>|H| = p^e</m>. That is, a Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroup of <m>G</m> is a subgroup whose order is the highest conceivable power of <m>p</m> according to Lagrange's Theorem.
          </p>

          <p>
            We set <m>\operatorname{Syl}_p(G)</m> to be the collection of all Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroups of <m>G</m> and <m>n_p=|\operatorname{Syl}_p(G)|</m> to be the number of Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroups.

      <historical>
        <p>
          Sylow subgroups are named after the Norwegian mathematician Ludwig Sylow, who was the first to systematically study their properties in the late 19th century.
        </p>

        <p>
          Sylow was interested in understanding the structure of finite groups and in particular, how the existence of certain subgroups of prime power order could provide information about the structure of the group as a whole. He introduced the concept of a Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroupa and showed that such subgroups play a crucial role in the structure of finite groups.

      </historical>

      <remark>
        <p>
          We allow the case when <m>p\nmid |G|</m>, in which case <m>e = 0</m> and <m>G</m> has a unique Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroup, namely <m>\{e\}</m> which has order <m>p^0</m>.
        </p>

      <problem>
        <p>
          In <m>D_{2p}</m> for a prime <m>p</m>, <m>\langle r \rangle</m> is a Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroup. If <m>p &gt; 2</m>, there is only one Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroup of <m>D_{2p}</m>, so <m>n_p=1</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          In <m>D_{2n}</m> for <m>n</m> odd, each of the subgroups <m>\langle sr^j \rangle</m>, for <m>j = 0, \dots, n-1</m> is a Sylow <m>2</m>-subgroup, so <m>n_2=p</m>.
        </p>
      </problem>

      <problem>
        <p>
          In <m>S_5</m>, the Sylow <m>5</m>-subgroups are the cyclic groups <m>\langle \sigma \rangle</m> for any five cycle <m>\sigma</m>, so <m>n_5=6</m> because there are 24 five cycles, but there are four of these in every Sylow 5-subgroup. The Sylow <m>3</m>-subgroups are the cyclic groups <m>\langle \sigma \rangle</m> for any three cycle <m>\sigma</m>, so <m>n_3=10</m> because there are 20 three cycles, but there are two of these in every Sylow 3-subgroup.
        </p>
        <p>
          A Sylow <m>2</m>-subgroup of <m>S_5</m> is any subgroup of order <m>8</m>. For example <m>\langle (1 \, 4)(2 \, 3) , (1 \, 2 \, 3 \, 4) \rangle</m> is a Sylow <m>2</m>-subgroup. There are many others.

        <title>Cauchy's Theorem</title>
        
        <statement>
          <p>
            If <m>G</m> is a finite group and <m>p</m> is a prime number dividing <m>|G|</m>, then <m>G</m> has an element of order <m>p</m>. (In fact, at least <m>p-1</m> elements of order <m>p</m>.)
          </p>
        </statement>
      </theorem>

      <historical>
        <p>
          Augustin-Louis Cauchy was a French mathematician who made important contributions to various branches of mathematics, including analysis, number theory, and geometry. He lived from 1789 to 1857 and is considered one of the greatest mathematicians of the 19th century. Cauchy proved his eponymous theorem in the early 19th century as part of his investigations into the theory of permutation groups. He was interested in understanding the structure of groups and their subgroups, and he realized that certain primes played a special role in this context.
        </p>
      </historical>

      <p>
        Cauchy's Theorem allows us to conclude the existence of certain elements in a group based solely on its order, which can be a powerful tool in studying the structure of groups. 
      </p>

      <p>
        For example, it can be used to prove the existence of subgroups of a given order in a group, and it is a key ingredient in the proof of Sylow's theorems, which provide information about the structure of finite groups. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Cauchy's theorem has since been generalized and extended in many ways, and it is now a fundamental result in the theory of finite groups, where it plays a central role in the classification of groups of small order.

                The Class Equation tells us <me>|G|=|Z(G)|+\sum\limits_{g\in G}[G:C_G(g)],</me>where <m>C_G(g)</m> are the centralizers with more than one element. Notice that this means <m>|C_G(g)|\big||G|</m>, and thus each centralizer is a power of <m>p</m>. Thus we have <me>p^n=|Z(G)|+pk</me>for some <m>k\in\N</m>. Thus the center of <m>G</m> cannot be trivial, else we would not be able to sum to a power of <m>p</m>.

                The trivial subgroup has order <m>1=p^0</m>. Suppose inductively that there exists a subgroup of order <m>p^{j}</m> that has a subgroup for every power of <m>p</m> in between.

                Consider, if you will, a group of order <m>p^{j+1}</m>, <m>H</m>. As this is a <m>p</m>-group, by Part (a) the center is nontrivial, making it a <m>p</m> group as well, and thus it has a subgroup of order <m>p</m>, <m>K</m>, which is normal in <m>H</m> as it lies within the center, so we mod out by <m>K</m> to see that <m>H</m> has a subgroup of order <m>p^j</m>, which has subgroups of all the other powers by the induction hypothesis.

              <p>
                First, we show that the center of <m>G</m> is nontrivial. Suppose by way of contradiction that <m>Z(G)=\{e\}</m>. We examine the conjugacy classes of <m>G</m>. From the Class Equation, we know<me>|G| = |Z(G)| + \sum_i^r |G : C_G(g_i)|.</me>Note that <m>|G|=p^n</m> for some <m>n\in\N</m>, meaning that the only divisors of <m>|G|</m> are powers of <m>p</m>. In finite groups, each conjugacy class must divide the order of the group. By Lagrange’s Theorem, <m>|G : C_G(g_i)|=\frac{|G|}{|C_G(g_i)|}=\frac{p^n}{p^m}=p^k</m>, where <m>m,k\in\N</m>. Since |Z(G)|=1, we see that <m>\sum_i^r |G : C_G(g_i)|\bigg|p^n-1</m>, which is impossible given that <m>p^n-1 \not|p^n</m>. Thus <m>Z(G)\neq\{e\}</m>.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                As <m>N\nsg G</m> it is a union of conjugacy classes of the elements it contains, one of which is <m>e</m>. Assume by way of contradiction that <m>N\cap Z(G)={e}</m>, meaning that <m>e</m> is the only element in <m>N</m> whose conjugacy class is a singleton. This yields <me>|N| = 1+ \sum_i^r |G : C_G(n_i)|.</me> However, by Lagrange’s Theorem <m>N</m> must also be a <m>p-</m>group, and thus by an analogous element counting argument as above we see that there exists some <m>x\in N</m> such that <m>C_G(x)=\{x\}</m>, or that <m>gxg\inv=x</m> for all <m>g\in G</m>. Thankfully, this means that <m>x\in Z(G)</m>, and thus we have <m>Z(G)\cap N\neq 1</m>.

      <p>
        Sylow's theorems provide a systematic way of analyzing the subgroups of a finite group. They allow us to determine the number of subgroups of a given order, which is useful in many applications, such as studying the structure of solvable and simple groups. The theorems also provide information about the normalizers of subgroups, which can be used to study normal subgroups and quotient groups.

      <problem>
        <p>
          We proceed via the contrapositive. Let <m>Q</m> be a Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroup, and suppose <m>PQ\leq G</m>. Thus <m>|PG|\big||G|</m>
        </p>

        <proof>
      		<p>
						Let <m>G</m> be a finite group and <m>p</m> a prime dividing the order of <m>G</m>. Let P be a Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroup.
					</p>

          <p>
            Note that <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> both have <m>p^k</m> elements, where <m>p^k</m> is the largest power of <m>p</m> that divides the order of <m>G</m>. Recall <m>|PQ|=\frac{|P||Q|}{|P\cap Q|}=\frac{p^{2k}}{|P\cap Q|}</m>. As <m>p^k</m> is the largest power of <m>p</m> that divides the order of <m>G</m>, we see that <m>|P\cap Q|</m> must be at least <m>p^k</m>. Thus <m>P=Q</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            First, note that <m>P\leq N_{G}(P)\leq N_G(N_G(P))</m>. Note that <m>N_G(P)</m> is the largest subgroup of <m>G</m> such that <m>P</m> is normal in <m>G</m>, making <m>P</m> the only Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroup of <m>N_G(P)</m>. Let <m>x\in N_G(N_G(P))</m>. Notice that <m>xPx\inv\leq xN_G(P)x\inv</m>, but as <m>x\in N_G(N_G(P))</m> we have <m>xN_G(P)x\inv=N_G(P)</m>. As <m>xPx\inv</m> is a Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroup that is contained in <m>N_G(P)</m>, we see that <m>xPx\inv=P</m>, placing <m>x\in N_G(P)</m>. Thus <m>N_G(P)=N_G(N_G(P))</m>.

                Let <m>G</m> be a group of order <m>385 = 5 · 7 · 11</m>. By Sylow's Theorem we know the <m>n_{11}|35</m> and <m>n_11\equiv 1\mod{11}</m>, and so <m>n_{11}=1</m>, making <m>P</m>, the unique Sylow <m>11</m>-subgroup of <m>G</m>, normal in <m>G</m>. Things are looking good thus far. We also know the following: - <m>n_7|55</m> and <m>n_7\equiv 1\mod{7}</m>, so <m>n_7=1</m> as well. Yeehaw.

                Let <m>P</m> denote the unique Sylow <m>7</m>-subgroup, and let <m>G</m> act on <m>P</m> by conjugation. Thus <m>\rho:G\to S_7</m>. The First Isomorphism Theorem tells us that <m>G/K\cong\im(\rho)\leq\Aut(P)</m>, where <m>K</m> is the kernel of <m>\rho</m>. However, <m>\Aut(P)=\Z_{7}^\times=\Z_6</m>, meaning that the order of <m>K</m> must divide both <m>385</m> and <m>6</m>, which cannot happen. Thus <m>K</m> must be trivial, meaning that <m>gxg\inv=x</m> for every <m>g\in G</m> and <m>x\in P</m>, making <m>P</m> a subgroup of <m>Z(G)</m> of order <m>7</m>.

As this is a homomorphism, we see the order of <m>G/\ker(\rho)</m> must divide both <m>10</m> and <m>231</m>, two numbers that are relatively prime. Thus <m>\ker(\rho)=1</m>, meaning that conjugation is equivalent to the identity map, or that <m>gxg\inv=x</m> for all <m>g\in G</m>. Thus <m>P\in Z(G)</m>.

        <p>
          In detail, say <m>P_1, \dots, P_4</m> are the <m>4</m> Sylow <m>3</m>-subgroups. By Lagrange <m>P_i \cap P_j = \{e\}</m> for all <m>i \ne j</m>. Thus the <em>set</em> <m>T := \bigcup_{i=1}^4 P_i</m> has <m>9</m> elements, one of which is <m>e</m> and the other <m>8</m> of which must have order <m>3</m>. That is, there are <m>8</m> elements of order <m>3</m> in <m>G</m>. But now consider the three Sylow <m>2</m>-subgroups <m>Q_1, Q_2, Q_3</m>. Each has order <m>4</m> and <m>Q_i \cap T = \{e\}</m> for all <m>i</m>. It follows that <m>Q_i = \{e\} \cup (G \setminus T)</m> for all <m>i</m>, and thus <m>Q_1 = Q_2 = Q_3</m>, a contradiction.

      <remark>
        <p>
          In the previous example, it would not be so easy to count elements of order <m>2</m> and <m>4</m>. We do know that every element in <m>S := \cup_i Q_i</m> has order <m>1</m>, <m>2</m> or <m>4</m> (any only one has order <m>1</m>), but the size of this set is harder to calculate. For notice that <m>Q_i \cap Q_j</m> might have order <m>2</m>. The most one can say for sure is that <m>S</m> has at least <m>4 + 4 - 2 = 6</m> elements.

							Let <m>G</m> be a simple group of order <m>60=2^2\cdot3\cdot 5.</m> By Sylow's Theorem we know that <m>n_5|12</m> and that <m>n_5\equiv 1\mod{5}</m>. Thus the options for <m>n_5</m> are <m>1</m> and <m>6</m>. Since <m>G</m> is simple we see that <m>n_5=6</m>. As each Sylow <m>5</m>-subgroup of <m>G</m> has <m>4</m> unique elements of order <m>5</m> and the identity we see that the number of elements or order <m>5</m> in <m>G</m> is <m>(5-1)\cdot 6=24</m>.

By Sylow's Theorem we know the following: - <m>n_3|10</m> and is congruent to <m>1\mod{3}</m>. As <m>G</m> is simple there must be ten of the fuckers. - <m>n_5|18</m> and is congruent to <m>1\mod 5</m>. As <m>G</m> is simple there must be six of them. Since each Sylow <m>3</m>-subgroup will have <m>3^2-1=8</m> non-identity elements and they are all distinct that accounts for <m>80</m> elements of order <m>3</m>. However, there are also <m>24</m> elements or order <m>5</m> to account for, which is a problem. Thus <m>G</m> cannot be simple.

              Suppose now that there exists <m>Q, Q' ∈ \Syl_3(G)</m> such that <m>|Q \cap Q'| = 3</m>. . Given this intersection, we know that <m>|QQ'|=9\cdot 9/3=27</m>. Additionally, note that as <m>Q \cap Q'</m> is a subgroup of both <m>Q</m> and <m>Q'</m> with index 3 in both, the smallest prime dividing the order or both, that <m>Q \cap Q'</m> is normal in both.
            </p>

            <p>
              We now consider the normalizer of <m>Q \cap Q'</m>, which we denote <m>N</m> for simplicity. As <m>N</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m> its order must divide <m>90</m> by Lagrange's Theorem. However, <m>QQ'\leq N</m>, and so <m>N</m> must have at least <m>27</m> elements, leaving the options of <m>45</m> and <m>90</m>. If <m>|N|=90</m> then <m>N=G</m>, making <m>Q\cap Q'</m> normal in <m>G</m>, a problem.
            </p>

            <p>
              If <m>|N|=45</m> then <m>[G:N]=2</m>, the smallest prime dividing <m>G</m>. Thus <m>N</m> is still normal, which is still a problem. Thus <m>G</m> cannot be simple.

              As <m>|S_4|=24&lt;36=|G|</m>, we see that <m>\rho</m> cannot be injective and thus <m>N=\ker(\rho)</m> is a non-trivial normal subgroup of <m>G</m>.

              Let <m>G</m> act on <m>\Syl_2(P)</m> by conjugation, yielding the permutation representation homomorphism <m>\rho:G\to S_{n_2}</m>. The kernel of this homomorphism cannot be trivial as the conjugation action on Sylow subgroups is transitive by Part (2) of Sylow's Theorem. Notice that if <m>n_2</m> is <m>3</m> or <m>5</m> then <m>|G|</m> does not divide the order of <m>S_{n_2}</m>, so our kernel cannot be all of <m>G</m>, making <m>\ker(\rho)</m> a nontrivial normal subgroup of <m>G</m>.

            <p>
              If <m>n_2=7</m>, then <m>G</m> must divide <m>7!</m>, meaning that <m>m=1</m>. However, by the cyclic subgroup generated by an element of order <m>7</m> has index <m>2</m> in <m>G</m>, making it normal.

              Thus <m>G</m> cannot be simple.
