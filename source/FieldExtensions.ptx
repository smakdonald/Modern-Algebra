              A <em>field extension</em> is an inclusion of one field <m>F</m> into a larger field <m>L</m>, making <m>F</m> into a subfield of <m>L</m>. We will write either <m>F \subseteq L</m> or <m>L/F</m> to signify that <m>L</m> is a field extension of <m>F</m>.

          <p>
            So a field extension is just another name for a subfield, but the emphasis is different. We think of <m>F</m> as coming first and <m>L</m> later.

            Recall that if <m>F</m> and <m>E</m> are fields, then every ring homomorphism <m>\phi: F \to E</m> necessarily injective. <xref provisional="empty"/>(Proof: since <m>\phi(1) = 1</m>, <m>\ker(\phi)</m> is a proper ideal of <m>F</m>, and since <m>F</m> is a field, the only proper ideal of it is <m>0</m>.) Thus <m>\phi</m> maps <m>F</m> isomorphically onto its image <m>\phi(F)</m> and <m>\phi(F) \subseteq E</m> is a field extension. By abuse of notation we will typically think of <m>\phi</m> as being a field extension, even though it is technically just an injective homomorphism of fields.

          <p>
            <m>\Q \subseteq \R</m> and <m>\R \subseteq \C</m> are basic examples of field extensions.
          </p>

          <p>
            Recall <xref provisional="empty"/> that <m>\Q[\sqrt{2}] = \{a + b \sqrt{2} \mid a, b \in \Q\}</m> is a field. So <m>\Q \subseteq \Q[\sqrt{2}]</m> is another example of a field extension.

        </example>

        <remark>
          <p>
            The latter is a typical sort of example for us: Starting with <m>\Q</m>, we would like to <q>adjoin</q> a root of the irreducible (in <m>\Q[x]</m>) polynomial <m>x^2 + 1</m>. Doing so yields <m>\Q[\sqrt{2}]</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            The previous example was a quadratic extension, which is misleadingly simple.
          </p>
        </remark>

        <example xml:id="exe-more-field-extensions">
          <p>
            Consider <m>x^3 - 2 \in \Q[x]</m>. It is irreducible (e.g., by Eisenstein)<xref provisional="empty"/> and has roots <m>\a = \sqrt[3]{2}</m>, <m>\beta = e^{2 \pi i/3} \sqrt[3]{2}</m> and <m>\g = e^{4 \pi i/3} \sqrt[3]{2}</m> in <m>\C</m>. So there are three ways in which we could “adjoin a root" to <m>\Q</m>: First we could form the field 
            <me>
              \Q[\a] = \{a + b \a + c \a^2 \mid a,b,c \in \Q\}.
            </me> 
            It is not completely obvious this is a field, but we'll prove it latter. The reason that we don't need third or higher powers is that, e.g., <m>\a^3 = 2 \in \Q</m>. Or we could instead form the field <m>\Q[\beta]</m> or the field <m>\Q[\gamma]</m>. There are clearly not all equal since, for example, <m>\Q[\a] \subseteq \R</m> but <m>\beta</m> is not in <m>\R</m>. However, they are {} field extensions as we will prove below.

            Note that, in the context of this definition, we have <m>F \subseteq F[\a] \subseteq F(\a) \subseteq L</m>, with each inclusion being a subring inclusion. <m>F, L</m> and <m>F(\a)</m> are all fields and in general <m>F[\a]</m> is only a ring. But, in some cases we have <m>F[\a] = F(\a)</m> (and hence it is a field). Indeed, this occurs whenever <m>\a</m> is the root of some polynomial with coefficients in <m>F</m>.

            <m>\Q[\pi]</m> is not a field (and so in particular it is not equal to <m>\Q(\pi)</m> since, for example, <m>\frac{1}{\pi} \notin \Q[\pi]</m>. (If it were, then we would have <m>\frac{1}{\pi} = \sum_{i=0}^n q_i \pi^i</m> for some <m>q_i \in \Q</m>, and hence <m>\sum_i q_i \pi^{i+1} - 1 = 0</m>, which would imply <m>\pi</m> is the root of a polynomial with rational coefficients.

          <proof>
            <p>
              Because <m>p(x)</m> is irreducible and <m>F[x]</m> is a PID, <m>(p(x))</m> is a maximal ideal <xref provisional="empty"/>. Thus <m>L = F[x]/(p(x))</m> is a field <xref provisional="empty"/>. The map <m>F \to L</m> given by <m>a \mapsto \ov{a}</m> is a ring map since it is the composition of the two ring maps <m>F \xra{can} F[x] \xra{can} F[x]/(p(x))</m> <xref provisional="empty"/>. Since it is a ring map between two fields, it is injective <xref provisional="empty"/>.
            </p>

            <p>
              The equality <m>[L:F]=\deg(p)</m> holds since <m>1, \ov{x}, \dots, \ov{x^{\deg(p)-1}}</m> is a basis for <m>L</m> regarded as an <m>F</m>-vector space, as we have seen before <xref provisional="empty"/>.
            </p>

            <p>
              The last assertion is tricky only because the notation is confusing. Say <m>p(x) = a_n x^n + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0</m> and just to keep things straight let's set <m>q(y) = \ov{a_n} y^n + \cdots + \ov{a_0} \in L[y]</m>. We need to show <m>q(\ov{x}) = 0</m>: We have 
              <me>
                q(\ov{x}) = \sum_i \ov{a_i} (\ov{x})^i =\sum_i \ov{a_i} (\ov{x^i}) = \ov{\sum_i a_i x_i}= \ov{p(x)}= 0.

        <example xml:id="exe-rxx21">
          <p>
            The last part of the proposition is notationally confusing to prove in general but clear in examples. So let's do a simple one: Say <m>F = \R</m> and <m>p(x)= x^2 +1</m>. Then <m>L = \R[x]/(x^2+1)</m>. The assertion is that <m>\ov{x} := x + (x^2 + 1) \in L</m> is a root of the polynomial <m>x^2 + 1</m> viewed as having coefficients in <m>L</m>. In other words, this element has the property that its square is <m>-1</m>. Let's check: Since <m>\ov{x^2 + 1} = 0</m> and <m>\ov{x^2 + 1} = \ov{x}^2 + 1</m> we have <m>\ov{x}^2 = -1</m>. Indeed, there is a field isomorphism <m>L \cong \C</m> sending <m>\ov{x}</m> to <m>i</m> and more generally <m>\ov{f}</m> to <m>f(i).</m>

              Let <m>\phi: F[x] \to L</m> be the evaluation homomorphism, given by sending <m>f(x)</m> to <m>f(\a)</m> <xref provisional="empty"/>. Note that <m>\phi</m> satisfies <m>\phi|_F = \id_F</m> and <m>\phi(x) = \alpha</m>. We have <m>\im(\phi) = F[\a]</m> by definition of the latter.

In particular, since <m>F[\a]</m> is a subring of <m>L</m>, it is an integral domain, <xref provisional="empty"/> and hence <m>I</m> must be a prime ideal (possibly the <m>0</m> ideal). <xref provisional="empty"/>
            </p>

            <p>
              Let us now prove the various parts:

            <p>
              For (3) assume <m>\a</m> is algebraic. Then <m>I \ne 0</m> and hence it has a unique monic generator, which we write <m>m_{\a, F}(x)</m>. Since <m>I</m> is prime, <m>m_{\a, F}(x)</m> is irreducible <xref provisional="empty"/>; this proves (3a). Also, this shows that <m>\frac{F[x]}{(m_{\a,F}(x))}</m> is a field <xref provisional="empty"/> and hence so is <m>F[\a]</m>. Since <m>F[\a] \subseteq F(\a)</m>, <m>F[\a]</m> contains <m>F</m> and <m>\a</m>, and <m>F[\a]</m> is a field, we must have <m>F[\a] = F(\a)</m>. This proves (3b) and (3c).

            <p>
              For (4), if <m>\a</m> is algebraic over <m>F</m>, then <m>[F(\a):F] = \deg(m_{\a, F}(x)) &lt; \infty</m> by (3b) and Proposition <xref provisional="empty"/>. For the converse, if <m>[F(\a): F] &lt; \infty</m>, then the infinite list <m>1, \a, \a^2, \dots</m> of elements of <m>F(\a)</m> cannot be <m>F</m>-linearly independent <xref provisional="empty"/>. So, <m>a_0 + a_1 \a + \cdots a_n \a^n = 0</m> for some <m>n</m> and some <m>a_0, \dots, a_n \in F</m> not all of which are <m>0</m>. This shows <m>\a</m> is the root of a non-zero polynomial.
            </p>

            <p>
              For (5), if <m>\a</m> is transcendental, then <m>I = 0</m> and so <m>\phi: F[x] \into L</m> is injective. Since <m>L</m> is a field, <m>F[x]</m> is a domain <xref provisional="empty"/>, and <m>\phi</m> is injective <xref provisional="empty"/>, it can be extended to the field of fractions <m>F(x)</m> of <m>F[x]</m>, i.e. there is a ring homomorphism <me>\tilde{\phi}: F(x) \to L</me>given by <m>\tilde{\phi} \left(\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\right) = \frac{f(\a)}{g(\a)}</m> for all <m>f(x), g(x) \in F[x]</m> with <m>g(x) \ne 0</m>. The image of <m>\tilde{\phi}</m> is precisely <m>F(\a)</m>. The map <m>\tilde{\phi}</m> is injective since it is a ring homomorphism whose source is a field. <xref provisional="empty"/>

            <p>
              Let <m>A \subseteq K</m> be a basis for <m>K</m> as an <m>L</m>-vector space and let <m>B \subseteq L</m> be a basis for <m>L</m> as an <m>F</m>-vector space. Let <m>AB</m> denote the subset <m>\{ab \mid a \in A, b \in B\}</m> of <m>K</m>. The Proposition follows from the following two facts: 
              - <m>AB</m> is a basis of <m>K</m> as an <m>F</m>-vector space and 
              - the function <m>A \times B \to AB, (a,b) \mapsto ab</m> is bijective (so that the cardinality of <m>AB</m> is <m>|A| \cdot |B|</m>). 
              
              Concerning (a), for <m>\a \in K</m>, we have <m>\a = \sum_i l_i a_i</m> for some <m>a_1, \dots, a_m \in A</m> and <m>l_1, \dots, l_m \in L</m>. For each <m>i</m>, <m>l_i</m> is an <m>F</m>-linear combination of a finite set of elements of <m>B</m>. Combining these gives that <m>\a</m> is in the <m>F</m>-span of <m>AB</m>.

            <p>
              To prove linear independence, it suffices to prove that if <m>a_1, \dots, a_m</m> and <m>b_1, \dots, b_n</m> be distinct elements of <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> respectively, then the set <m>\{a_ib_j\}</m> is linearly independent. Suppose <m>\sum_{i,j} f_{i,j} a_i b_j = 0</m> for some <m>f_{i,j} \in F</m>. Since the <m>b_j</m>'s are <m>L</m>-linearly independent and <me>\sum_{i,j} f_{i,j} a_i b_j = \sum_j (\sum_i f_{i,j} a_i) b_j</me>and <m>f_{i,j} a_i \in L</m>, we get that, for each <m>j</m>, <m>\sum_i f_{i,j} a_i = 0</m>. Using now that the <m>a_i</m>'s are <m>F</m>-linearly independent, we have that for all <m>j</m> and all <m>i</m>, <m>f_{i,j} = 0</m>. This proves <m>\{a_i b_j \mid i = 1, \dots, m, j = 1, \dots, n\}</m> is linearly independent over <m>F</m>, and hence <m>AB</m> is linearly independent over <m>F</m>.

As we shall see later, <m>F</m> is an example of a “splitting field". Let's find <m>[F: \Q]</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            First, let us note that we can also describe <m>F</m> as <m>F = \Q(\sqrt[4]{5}, i)</m>. This holds since each of <m>\a_1, \dots, \a_4</m> belongs to <m>\Q(\sqrt[4]{5}, i)</m> and hence <m>F \subseteq \Q(\sqrt[4]{5}, i)</m>. The opposite containment holds because <m>\sqrt[4]{5}, i \in F</m>, with the latter being true because <m>i = \a_2/\a_1</m>.

          <p>
            Set <m>E = \Q(i)</m>. Then <m>[E: \Q] = 2</m>. Since <m>F = E(\sqrt[4]{5})</m> and <m>\sqrt[4]{5}</m> is a root of <m>x^4-5</m>, we have <m>[F : E]</m> is at most <m>4</m> and it will be exactly <m>4</m> if and only if <m>x^4 -5</m> is irreducible in <m>\Q(i)[x]</m>. This is unclear.

          <p>
            So instead let's try a different approach. Let <m>L = \Q(\sqrt[4]{5})</m>. Then since <m>x^4 - 5</m> is irreducible in <m>\Q[x]</m> by Eisenstein, we have <m>[L: \Q] = 4</m>. Since <m>F = L(i)</m> and <m>i</m> is a root of <m>x^2 +1</m>, we have <m>[F:L] \leq 2</m>. But <m>F \ne L</m> since <m>F \subseteq \R</m>. Note that <m>[F:L] = 1</m> if and only if <m>F = L</m>. Thus <m>[F:L] = 2</m>.

              As seen in Example 2.60, <m>e^{2\pi i/p}</m> is a root of the <m>(n-1)</m>th cyclotomic polynomial, which is monic and irreducible in <m>\Q</m>. Hence <m>e^{2\pi i/p}</m> is the minimal polynomial of the <m>(n-1)</m>th cyclotomic polynomial in <m>\Q[x]</m>, and thus the field extension <m>\Q(e^{2\pi i/p})</m> has degree <m>p-1</m> over <m>\Q</m> by Theorem 2.31. It follows that <m>[\Q(e^{2\pi i/p}):\Q]=p-1</m>.

            <p>
              Next, note that <m>\sqrt[p]{2}</m> is a root of the polynomial <m>x^p-2</m>, making it algebraic over <m>\Q</m>. Using Eisenstein's Criterion in conjunction with the prime <m>q=2</m> we see that <m>x^p-2</m> is irreducible in <m>\Q[x]</m>. As <m>\gcd(p,p-1)=1</m>, by Problem 5 on the previous homework we see that <m>x^p-2</m> is irreducible in <m>\Q(\sqrt[p]{2})</m> as well. As <m>x^p-2</m> is irreducible and monic, we see that it is the minimal polynomial of <m>\sqrt[p]{2}</m> in <m>\Q(e^{2\pi i/p})[x]</m>, and thus <me>[\Q(e^{2\pi i/p},\sqrt[p]{2}):\Q(e^{2\pi i/p})]=p.</me> Using the degree formula, we see that <me>[\Q(\sqrt[p]{2},e^{2\pi i/p}):\Q]=[\Q(e^{2\pi i/p},\sqrt[p]{2}):\Q(e^{2\pi i/p})][\Q(\sqrt[p]{2}):\Q]=p(p-1).</me> Notice that <m>\sqrt[p]{2}\cdot (e^{{2\pi i/p}^n})</m>, where <m>1\leq n\leq p</m>, which are all roots of <m>x^p-2</m>. By the Factor Theorem, there can be no other roots of this polynomial. Thus <m>L\subseteq\Q(\sqrt[p]{2},e^{2\pi i/p})</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              Additionally, notice that <m>e^{2\pi i/p}</m> and <m>\sqrt[p]{2}</m> are both roots of <m>x^p-2</m>. Thus they are both contained in <m>L</m>. Observe <m>\frac{e^{2\pi i/p}\sqrt[p]{2}}{\sqrt[p]{2}}=e^{2\pi i/p}</m>. Hence <m>\Q(\sqrt[p]{2},e^{2\pi i/p})\subseteq L</m>, and thus we see that <m>L=\Q(\sqrt[p]{2},e^{2\pi i/p})</m>. Therefore, <m>[L:\Q]=p(p-1)</m>.

            <p>
              We're going to go slightly out of order. By Part (b), we see <m>[KL : E] = k\ell</m> when <m>\gcd(k,\ell) = 1</m>. This is the largest possible size of <m>KL</m>, as everything is irreducible where it can be. Thus <m>[KL : E] \leq k\ell</m>

            <p>
              Suppose <m>\gcd(k,\ell) = 1</m>. As <m>K</m> and <m>L</m> are finite extensions of <m>E</m> they are also algebraic. Thus there exists <m>\a\in K</m> and <m>\b\in L</m> such that <m>\mp_\a(x)</m> has degree <m>k</m> and <m>\mp_\b(x)</m> has degree <m>\ell</m>.

            <p>
              Thus <m>\gcd(\deg\mp_\a(x),\ell) = 1</m>, making <m>\mp_\a(x)</m> irreducible in <m>L[x]</m>. Thus <m>[L(\a):L]=k</m>. Notice that <m>E(\a,\b)=KL</m>, as it is the smallest (with respect to containment) subfield of <m>F</m> which satisfies <m>K\subseteq KL</m> and <m>L\subseteq KL</m>. Thus we have <m>[KL:E]=k\ell</m>, as desired.

              It is far from clear that <m>\ov{F}</m> is a subfield of <m>L</m>, and so we first prove that: Given <m>\a, \beta \in \ov{F}</m>, we have that <m>[F(\a): F]</m> and <m>[F(\a, \beta): F(\a)]</m> are finite and hence so is <m>[F(\a, \beta): F]</m>.

              It is clear from the definition that <m>F \subseteq \ov{F}</m> is an algebraic field extension.

              Given a non-constant <m>g(x) \in \ov{F}[x]</m>, let <m>\a</m> be one of its roots in <m>L</m> (which exists since we assume <m>L</m> is algebraically closed).

            <p>
              Let <m>\cT</m> be any totally ordered subset of <m>\cS</m>. If <m>\cT</m> is empty, then <m>F \in \cS</m> is an upper bound for <m>\cT</m>.

              By construction <m>L</m> is algebraic over <m>F</m>. If <m>L</m> were not algebraically closed, then there would be a non-trivial algebraic extension <m>L \subsetneq E</m> of it, by Proposition .

            In general, given <m>f(x) \in \Q[x]</m>, a splitting field of <m>f(x)</m> is given by <m>\Q(\a_1, \dots, \a_n)</m> where <m>\a_1, \dots, \a_n \in \C</m> are all of the roots of <m>f(x)</m> in <m>\C</m>.

            More generally, we may speak of the splitting field of a list of polynomials in <m>F[x]</m>: it is a field extension over which each polynomial factors completely and which is generated by all the roots of all the polynomials.
          </p>

          <p>
            Note that given a finite list <m>f_1(x), \dots, f_k(x) \in F[x]</m>, a splitting field for this list is identical to a splitting field for their product <m>f_1(x)\cdots f_k(x)</m>.

            <p>
              Let <m>F</m> be a field and <m>f(x) \in F[x]</m> a non-constant polynomial. 
              1. There exists a splitting field <m>L</m> for <m>f(x)</m> over <m>F</m>. 
              2. If <m>F \subseteq L'</m> is another splitting field of <m>f(x)</m> over <m>F</m>, then there is a field isomorphism <m>\s: L \xra{\cong} L'</m> such that <m>\s|_F = \id_F</m>. 
              3. The degree of any splitting field of <m>f(x)</m> is at most <m>n!</m> where <m>n = \deg(f)</m>.
            </p>
          </statement>

          <proof>
            <p>
              For (1), let <m>\ov{F}</m> be an algebraic closure of <m>F</m>, which exists by the previous Theorem. Let <m>\a_1, \dots, \a_m</m> be the roots of <m>f(x)</m> in <m>\ov{F}</m>, and set <m>L = F(\a_1, \dots, \a_m)</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              It is clear <m>L</m> is a splitting field.
            </p>

            <p>
              To prove (2), we proceed by induction on the degree of <m>f(x)</m>. If <m>f</m> is linear, then the only splitting field of <m>f</m> over <m>F</m> is <m>F</m> itself and so the result is clear in this case. Say <m>\a_1, \dots, \a_m</m> and <m>\a'_1, \dots, \a'_m</m> are the roots of <m>f(x)</m> in <m>L</m> and <m>L'</m>, respectively, and say they are ordered so that, <m>\a_m</m> and <m>\a'_m</m> are roots of the same irreducible factor of <m>f(x)</m> in <m>F[x]</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              By Corollary  there is an isomorphism <m>\phi: F(\a_n) \xra{\cong} F(\a_n')</m> that fixes <m>F</m>. Note that <m>f(x)</m> factors as <m>(x-\a_n) g(x)</m> in <m>F(\a_n)[x]</m> and that <m>L</m> is the splitting field of <m>g(x)</m> over <m>F(\a_n)</m>, and similarly <m>f(x)</m> factors as <m>(x-\a'_n) g'(x)</m> in <m>F(\a'_n)[x]</m> and that <m>L</m> is the splitting field of <m>g'(x)</m> over <m>F(\a'_n)</m>. If we blur our eyes slightly and pretend <m>\phi</m> is the identity map, we can apply the inductive hypothesis, since <m>\deg(g) &lt; \deg(f)</m>, to conclude that there is an isomorphism <m>\s</m> as in the statement. I leave a more rigorous argument to your imaginations.
            </p>

            <p>
              To prove (3), we also proceed by induction on the degree of <m>f</m>, using the same notation as in the proof of (2).
            </p>

            <p>
              Since <m>\a_n</m> is a root of <m>f(x)</m>, we have <m>m_{F,\a_n} \mid f(x)</m> and hence <me>[F(\a_n): F] = \deg(m_{F,\a_n})  \leq n.</me> In <m>F(\a_n)</m> we have <m>f(x) = (x-\a_n) g(x)</m> with <m>g(x) \in F(\a_n)[x]</m> and, as before, <m>L</m> is the splitting field of <m>g(x)</m> over <m>F(\a_n)</m>, so that by induction <m>[L: F(\a_n)] \leq (n-1)!</m>. By the degree formula <me>[L: F] = [L: F(\a_n)][F(\a_n): F] \leq (n-1)! \cdot n = n!.</me>

          </proof>
        </theorem>

        <remark>
          <p>
            Recall from before that we proved there exists a field extension <m>F \subseteq E</m> in which <m>f(x)</m> has at least one root. So <m>f(x) = (x-\a_1) g(x)</m> for some <m>\a_1 \in E</m> and <m>g(x) \in E[x]</m>. We can then find a field extension of <m>E</m> in which <m>g</m> has at least one root <m>\a_2</m>, and so on. In this way we build a field extension <m>F \subseteq K</m> such that <m>g</m> factors in <m>K</m> as <m>c\prod_{i=1}^n (x - \a_i)</m> for some <m>c, \a_1, \dots, \a_n \in K</m>. Finally, <m>L = F(\a_1, \dots, \a_n)</m> is a splitting field of <m>f</m>.

        <example xml:id="exe-splitting-fields-and-x3-2">
          <p>
            The splitting field <m>L</m> of <m>x^3 -2</m> over <m>\Q</m> is <m>L = \Q(\sqrt[3]{2}, \zeta_3 \sqrt[3]{2}, \zeta_3^2 \sqrt[3]{2})</m>, where <m>\zeta_3 = e^{\frac{2 \pi i}{3}}</m>. It is not hard to see that <m>L = \Q(\sqrt[3]{2}, \zeta_3)</m>. We have <m>[\Q(\sqrt[3]{2}): \Q] = 3</m> since <m>x^3 - 2</m> is irreducible in <m>\Q[x]</m> (by Eisenstein). Since <m>\Q(\sqrt[3]{2}) \subseteq \R</m> and thus <m>\Q(\sqrt[3]{2}) \ne L</m>, the degree formula gives that <m>[L: \Q] \geq 6</m>. By the Theorem, <m>[L: \Q] \leq 6</m> and hence <m>[L: \Q] = 6</m>. (We could also have proven this without appealing to the Theorem.)

        </example>

        <example xml:id="exe-splitting-fields-and-x4-5x26">
          <p>
            The splitting field of <m>f(x) = x^4 - 5x^2 + 6</m> is <me>
\Q(\sqrt{2}, -\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}, -\sqrt{3}) = \Q(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}) = \Q(\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}).
</me> This holds since <m>f(x) = (x^2-3)(x^2-2)</m>. It is not too hard to see that the degree of this splitting field over <m>\Q</m> is <m>4</m>, far smaller than the <m>4!</m> upper bound given by the Theorem.
          </p>
        </example>

        <example xml:id="exe-splitting-fields-and-xn-1">
          <p>
            Let <m>f(x) = x^n -1 \in \Q[x]</m>. Then <m>f(x)</m> splits completely in <m>\C[x]</m> and its roots are the <m>n</m> <m>n</m>-th roots of <m>1</m>. One of these is <m>\zeta_n := e^{2 \pi i/n}</m>. Notice that every other <m>n</m>-th root of <m>1</m> is a power of this one. We thus see that <m>\Q(\zeta_n)</m> is the splitting field of <m>x^n-1</m> over <m>\Q</m>. This field is called the {} of <m>n-th</m> roots of 1 over <m>\Q</m>. This is a somewhat special example: upon joining one of the roots of <m>f</m> we got all the others for free. This happens in other examples too, but is certainly {} a general principle.
          </p>

          <p>
            In particular, we see that the degree of <m>\Q \subseteq \Q(\zeta_n)</m> is at most <m>n</m>, far less than the bound of <m>n!</m> given by the Proposition above. In fact, it is at most <m>n-1</m> since <m>f</m> factors as <m>(x-1)(x^{n-1} + \cdots + x + 1)</m>, and hence the minimum polynomial of <m>\zeta_n</m> is a divisor of <m>x^{n-1} + \cdots + x + 1</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            When <m>n = p</m> is prime, then <m>x^{p-1} + \cdots + x + 1</m> is irreducible, as we proved before, and hence it must equal the minimum polynomial of <m>\zeta_p</m>. So, in this case, the degree of <m>\Q \subseteq \Q(\zeta_p)</m> is exactly <m>p-1</m>, but it can be smaller than <m>n-1</m> in general; for example, when <m>n = 4</m>, <m>\zeta_4= i</m> and <m>[\Q(i): \Q] = 2</m>. Note that <m>x^3 + x^2 + x + 1</m> factors as <m>(x^2+1)(x+1)</m> and of course <m>m_{i, \Q}(x) = x^2 + 1</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            The irreducible polynomial <m>m_{\zeta_n, \Q}(x)</m> is known as the {}.

              We basically already proved this, but since it is of large importance, let's do so again:
            </p>

            <p>
              Since <m>\a, \beta</m> are roots of the same irreducible polynomial, by Corollary  there is an isomorphism <m>\tau: F(\a) \to F(\beta)</m> such that <m>\tau|_F = \id_F</m> and <m>\tau(\a) = \beta</m>. We have two field maps, <m>F(\a) \into L</m> (actual inclusion) and the composition of <m>F(\a) \xra{\tau} F(\beta)\into L</m>, and they realize <m>L</m> as the splitting field of <m>f(x)</m> over <m>F(\a)</m> in two different ways. Since splitting fields are unique, an isomorphism such as <m>\s</m> exists.

              First, note that <m>f</m> is irreducible in <m>\Q[x]</m> by Eisenstein's Criterion (<m>p=3</m>) The roots of <m>f</m> are 
              - <m>\sqrt[4]3</m>,
              - <m>\sqrt[4]3i</m>, 
              - <m>-\sqrt[4]3</m>, and 
              - <m>-\sqrt[4]3i</m>. 
              Let <m>F=\Q(\sqrt[4]3)</m> and notice <m>[F:\Q]=4</m>. As <m>F\subseteq\R</m> we see that <m>[F(i):F]=2</m>, and thus <m>[K:\Q]=8</m>, meaning our basis will have eight elements: 1. 1 2. <m>\sqrt[4]3</m> 3. <m>(\sqrt[4]3)^2</m> 4. <m>(\sqrt[4]3)^3</m> 5. <m>i</m> 6. <m>\sqrt[4]3i</m> 7. <m>(\sqrt[4]3)^2i</m> 8. <m>(\sqrt[4]3)^3i</m>

              Now that <m>K</m> has been verified to be a splitting field, we see that <m>\Aut(K/Q)</m> is isomorphic to a subgroup of <m>S_4</m> of degree <m>8</m>.

            <p>
              If there are three they are all conjugate, and conjugation induces an isomorphism on the group, we see that all three subgroups are isomorphic.

              Let <m>X</m> be the set of left cosets of the subgroup <m>\{e,s\}</m> of <m>D_8</m>. Note that <m>|X| = 4</m>. Let <m>G</m> act on <m>X</m> by left multiplication. This action induces a homomorphism <m>\varphi : G \to P(X)</m> where <m>P(X)\cong S_4</m> is the permutation group on <m>X</m>. As shown in class, the kernel of this homomorphism is the largest normal subgroup contained in <m>\{e,s\}</m>, which is <m>\{e\}</m>. Thus, <m>\varphi</m> is injective and the image of <m>\varphi</m> is a subgroup of <m>S_4</m> isomorphic to <m>D_8</m>.

              As <m>E</m> is the splitting field of an irreducible polynomial in <m>F[x]</m>, by Theorem 2.90 we see that <m>|\Aut(E/\Q)|=[E:\Q]=8</m>. In the Gaussian integers, it is known that if both <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are nonzero then, <m>a+bi</m> is a Gaussian prime if and only if <m>a^2+b^2</m> is an ordinary prime. Note that <m>5=(2-i)(2+i)</m>, and that <m>2^2+i^2=3</m>, which is prime. Thus <m>2+i</m> is prime in <m>\Z[i]</m>. Thus we may invoke Eisenstein's Criterion using <m>p=2+i</m> to see that <m>x^4+5</m> is irreducible in <m>\Q(i)</m>, as <m>(2+i)^2=3-2i</m> does not divide 5, but we'll prove it just to be sure.
            </p>

            <p>
              Suppose <m>(3+2i)|5</m>. Then <m>(3+2i)(a+bi)=5</m>, so <m>3a+3bi+2ai-2b=5</m>, and thus <m>3a-2b+(2a+3b)i=5</m>. As 5 has no imaginary component, it must be the case that <m>2a+3b=0</m>, and thus that <m>a=-\frac{3}{2}b</m>. Substituting in, we see that <m>-\frac{9}{2}b-3b=5</m>, and thus that <m>b=-\frac{10}{3}</m>, which has historically not been an integer.
            </p>

            <p>
              Anyway, we may thus apply Porism 2.61 to see that there exists some <m>\tau\in\Aut(E/\Q(i))</m> such that <m>\tau(\alpha_1)=\alpha_2</m>. We may regard <m>\tau</m> as an element of <m>\Aut(E/\Q)</m> since, by definition, <m>\Aut(E/\Q(i))</m> is a subgroup of <m>\Aut(E/\Q)</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              As <m>\tau(\alpha_1)=\alpha_2</m>, observe the following glory: <me>\begin{align}
    \tau(\alpha_1)&amp;=\alpha_2\\
    \tau(\sqrt[4]{5/4}(1+i))&amp;=\sqrt[4]{5/4}(-1+i)\\
    \tau(\sqrt[4]{5/4})\tau(1+i)&amp;=\sqrt[4]{5/4}(-1+i)\\
    \tau(\sqrt[4]{5/4})(1+i)&amp;=\sqrt[4]{5/4}(-1+i)\\
    \tau(\sqrt[4]{5/4})&amp;=\frac{\sqrt[4]{5/4}(-1+i)}{(1+i)}\\
    \tau(\sqrt[4]{5/4})&amp;=\frac{\sqrt[4]{5/4}(-1+i)}{(1+i)}\frac{(1-i)}{(1-i)}\\
    \tau(\sqrt[4]{5/4})&amp;=\frac{\sqrt[4]{5/4}(2i)}{2}\\
    \tau(\sqrt[4]{5/4})&amp;=\sqrt[4]{5/4}i
\end{align}</me> With that in mind, we examine <me>\begin{align}
    \tau(\alpha_2)&amp;=\tau(\sqrt[4]{5/4}(-1+i))\\
    &amp;=\tau(\sqrt[4]{5/4})\tau(-1+i)\\
    &amp;=\tau(\sqrt[4]{5/4})(-1+i)\\
    &amp;=\sqrt[4]{5/4}i(-1+i)\\
    &amp;=\sqrt[4]{5/4}(-1-i)\\
    &amp;=\alpha_3,
\end{align}</me> and <me>\begin{align}
    \tau(\alpha_3)&amp;=\tau(\sqrt[4]{5/4}(-1-i))\\
    &amp;=\tau(\sqrt[4]{5/4})\tau(-1-i)\\
    &amp;=\tau(\sqrt[4]{5/4})(-1-i)\\
    &amp;=\sqrt[4]{5/4}i(-1-i)\\
    &amp;=\sqrt[4]{5/4}(1-i)\\
    &amp;=\alpha_4,
\end{align}</me> and don't forget <me>\begin{align}
    \tau(\alpha_4)&amp;=\tau(\sqrt[4]{5/4}(1-i))\\
    &amp;=\tau(\sqrt[4]{5/4})\tau(1-i)\\
    &amp;=\tau(\sqrt[4]{5/4})(1-i)\\
    &amp;=\sqrt[4]{5/4}i(1-i)\\
    &amp;=\sqrt[4]{5/4}(1+i)\\
    &amp;=\alpha_1,
\end{align}</me> So <m>\tau</m> corresponds to the permutation (1 2 3 4). We have proven that <m>\Aut(E/\Q(i))</m> is isomorphic to a subgroup of <m>S_4</m> having order at most 8 and that it contains an element or order 2 and (1 2 3 4), an element of order 4. Since the subgroup generated by these two elements has order 8, we see that <m>\Aut(E/\Q) \cong D_8</m>. (Also by Sylow's Theorem, <m>S_4</m> only has one subgroup of order 8, and it is <m>D_8</m>).

            <p>
              Let <m>L</m> be the splitting field of <m>f(x)=x^5 - 11</m> over <m>\Q</m>
            </p>

            <p>
              First, notice that by Eisenstein's Criterion]] (<m>p=11</m>) we have <m>f</m> irreducible in <m>\Q</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              The roots of <m>f</m> are the following: 1. <m>\a_1=\sqrt[5]{11}\z</m> 2. <m>\a_2=\sqrt[5]{11}\z^2</m> 3. <m>\a_3=\sqrt[5]{11}\z^3</m> 4. <m>\a_4=\sqrt[5]{11}\z^4</m> 5. <m>\a_5=\sqrt[5]{11}\z^5=\sqrt[5]{11}</m>
            </p>

            <p>
              As <m>f</m> is monic and irreducible, it is the minimum polynomial of <m>\a_5</m>. Let <m>E=\Q(\a_5)</m> and notice <m>[E:\Q]=5</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              Notice that <m>\z</m>, a primitive <m>5</m>-th root of unity, is the root of <m>g(x)=x^4+x^3+x^2+x+1</m>, the fourth cyclotomic polynomial, which is monic and irreducible in <m>\Q[x]</m> (See: [[Proposition – Cyclotomic Polynomial Irreducible|Result]]). Thus <m>g</m> is the minimum polynomial of <m>\z</m> and <m>[F:\Q]=4</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              We know that <m>L=\Q(\sqrt[5]{11},\z)</m>, as every generator of <m>L</m> can be written using <m>\z</m> and <m>\sqrt[5]{11}.</m> Let <m>[L:\Q]=n</m>, <m>[L:F]=p</m>, and <m>[L:E]=q</m>. By the [[Proposition – The Degree Formula|Degree Formula]], we have - <m>[L:\Q]=[L:F][F:\Q]</m>, and thus <m>n=4p</m> - <m>[L:\Q]=[L:E][E:\Q]</m>, and thus <m>n=5q</m> As <m>E\neq L</m> and <m>F\neq L</m> we know that <m>p,q&gt;1</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              Thus we have <m>n=20</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              Let <m>F = \Q(\zeta)</m> where <m>\zeta = e^{2\pi i/5}</m>. From Part (a) we know <m>[L:F]=5</m>. As <m>L=F(\a)</m>, we know that <m>\mp_\a(x)</m> has degree <m>5</m>. As <m>f</m> is a monic polynomial of degree <m>5</m>, we see that it is the minimum polynomial and thus irreducible.

                Let <m>E</m> be the splitting field of <m>f(x)=x^4 + 5</m> over <m>\Q</m>.
              </p>

              <p>
                First, we note that the roots of <m>f</m> are the following: 
                <m>\a_1=\sqrt[4]5e^{\pi i/4}=\sqrt[4]5 (\cos(\frac{\pi}{4}))+i\sin(\frac{\pi}{4}))=\sqrt[4]5(\frac{\sqrt 2}{2}+i\frac{\sqrt 2}{2})=\frac{\sqrt 2}{2}\sqrt[4]5(1+i)=\frac{\sqrt[4]{20}}{2}(1+i),</m> 
                <m>\a_2=\sqrt[4]5e^{3\pi i/4}=\sqrt[4]5 (\cos(\frac{3\pi}{4}))+i\sin(\frac{3\pi}{4}))=\sqrt[4]5(\frac{-\sqrt 2}{2}+i\frac{\sqrt 2}{2})=\frac{\sqrt 2}{2}\sqrt[4]5(-1+i)=\frac{\sqrt[4]{20}}{2}(-1+i),</m> 
                <m>\a_3=\sqrt[4]5e^{5\pi i/4}=\sqrt[4]5 (\cos(\frac{5\pi}{4}))+i\sin(\frac{5\pi}{4}))=\sqrt[4]5(\frac{-\sqrt 2}{2}+i\frac{-\sqrt 2}{2})=\frac{\sqrt 2}{2}\sqrt[4]5(-1-i)=\frac{\sqrt[4]{20}}{2}(-1-i),</m> and 
                <m>\a_4=\sqrt[4]5e^{7\pi i/4}=\sqrt[4]5 (\cos(\frac{7\pi}{4}))+i\sin(\frac{7\pi}{4}))=\sqrt[4]5(\frac{\sqrt 2}{2}+i\frac{-\sqrt 2}{2})=\frac{\sqrt 2}{2}\sqrt[4]5(1-i)=\frac{\sqrt[4]{20}}{2}(1-i).</m> 
                First we examine <m>F=\Q(\sqrt[4]{20})</m>. Notice that <m>\sqrt[4]{20}</m> is a root of the polynomial <m>x^4-20</m>, which is irreducible in <m>\Q[x]</m> using Eisenstein's Criterion]] with <m>p=5</m>. Thus <m>x^4-20</m> is monic and irreducible, making it the minimum polynomial of <m>\sqrt[4]{20}</m>. Thus <m>[F:\Q]=4</m>. Notice that <m>\a_1+\a_4=\frac{\sqrt[4]{20}}{2}(1+i+1-i)=\sqrt[4]{20}</m>, so <m>\sqrt[4]{20}\in E</m>. Thus there exists <m>\Q\subseteq F\subseteq E</m> such that <m>F \sse \R</m> and <m>[F : \Q] = 4</m>.
              </p>

              <p>
                Now let <m>K=F(i)</m>. Notice that <m>i</m> is a root of the polynomial <m>x^2+1</m>, which is irreducible in <m>F[x]</m> as <m>F\subseteq\R</m> and <m>i\not\in\R</m>. Thus <m>x^2+1</m> is monic and irreducible, making it the minimal polynomial of <m>i</m> Thus <m>[K:F]=2</m> and <m>[K:\Q]=8</m> by the [[Proposition – The Degree Formula|Degree Formula]].
              </p>

              <p>
                Notice that <m>\a_1+\a_4=\frac{\sqrt[4]{20}}{2}(1+i+1-i)=\sqrt[4]{20}</m>, so <m>\sqrt[4]{20}\in E</m>. Thus so is <m>\frac{1}{\sqrt[4]{20}}</m>, and so we see that <m>i=\a_1\cdot\frac{1}{\sqrt[4]{20}}-1</m>, and thus that <m>i\in E</m> as well, making <m>K\subseteq E</m>. As seen in Part (a), each root can be expressed in terms of <m>i</m> and <m>\sqrt[4]{20}</m>, and so <m>E\subseteq K</m> as well. Hence <m>K=E</m> and we have <m>[E : \Q]=[K:\Q]=8</m>.

Using Eisenstein's Criterion with <m>p=5</m> we see that <m>f</m> is irreducible in <m>\Q[x]</m>. Notice that <m>\sqrt[p]5</m> is a root of this polynomial.

Notice that <m>\z</m> is a root of the <m>(p-1)\th</m> cyclotomic polynomial, <m>g(x)</m>, which is irreducible in <m>\Q[x]</m> by the Gospel of Mark.

              <p>
                As <m>L</m> is the splitting field of <m>g</m>, there exists a root <m>\a</m> of <m>g\in L</m>. Consider <m>\Q(\sqrt[p]5,\a)</m>. As <m>\a</m> is algebraic in <m>\Q(\sqrt[p]5,\a)</m> we know there exists some unique irreducible minimal polynomial <m>h</m> of degree <m>q</m>, and thus that <m>[\Q(\sqrt[p]5,\a):\Q(\sqrt[p]5)]=q</m>. By the Degree Formula we see <me>[\Q(\sqrt[p]5,\a):\Q]=[\Q(\sqrt[p]5,\a):\Q(\sqrt[p]5][\Q(\sqrt[p]5:\Q]=pq.</me>However, <m>[\Q(\sqrt[p]5,\a):\Q]=[\Q(\sqrt[p]5,\a):\Q(\a)][\Q(\a):\Q]</m> and so <m>pq=(p-1)m</m> for some <m>m\in\Z</m>, so <m>(p-1)|pq</m>. As <m>\gcd((p-1),p)=1</m> we must have <m>(p-1)|q</m>. But <m>q</m> was defined to be the degree of <m>h</m>, which divides <m>g</m>. As <m>(p-1)|q</m> and <m>q\leq (p-1)</m>, we see that <m>(p-1)=q</m>, so <m>g=kh</m> for some <m>k\in \Q</m>. As irreducible polynomials multiplied by a constant are still irreducible, we see that <m>g</m> is indeed irreducible in <m>\Q(\sqrt[p]5)</m>.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                As <m>g</m> is monic and irreducible in <m>\Q(\sqrt[p]5)</m> we see that it is the minimum polynomial of <m>\z</m>, and thus <m>[\Q(\sqrt[p]5,\a):\Q(\sqrt[p]5)]=(p-1)</m>. As <m>\Q(\sqrt[p]5,\a)=L</m>, we have <m>[L:\Q]=p(p-1)</m>.
